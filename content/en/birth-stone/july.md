## About Ruby

### Gemological Profile

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Mineral Family | Corundum |
| Chemical Composition | Aluminum Oxide (Al₂O₃) with Chromium |
| Hardness (Mohs) | 9 |
| Primary Sources | Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Sri Lanka, Madagascar, Mozambique |
| Colors | Red to pinkish-red, with "pigeon blood" red being most prized |

### Description

Ruby is one of the most coveted gemstones in the world, renowned for its stunning red color that ranges from pinkish-red to deep crimson. The finest rubies exhibit a color often described as "pigeon blood red"—a pure, vivid red with a hint of blue that creates an almost fluorescent glow. This exceptional color comes from trace amounts of chromium within the crystal structure, the same element that gives rubies their remarkable hardness.

What makes ruby truly extraordinary is its combination of beauty and durability. As a variety of corundum, ruby shares its mineral family with sapphire, differing only in the trace elements that create its signature color. With a hardness of 9 on the Mohs scale, ruby is second only to diamond in durability, making it an excellent choice for jewelry meant to last generations.

The most valuable rubies display a phenomenon called "silk"—fine needle-like inclusions of rutile that, when present in the right amount, create a soft, velvety appearance and can enhance the stone's color. Star rubies, which display a six-rayed star pattern called asterism, are particularly prized collector's pieces.

### Formation & Rarity

Rubies form deep within the Earth's crust under conditions of extreme heat and pressure. They typically develop in metamorphic rocks, particularly marble and basalt, where aluminum-rich minerals undergo transformation over millions of years. The presence of chromium during this process is what transforms ordinary corundum into precious ruby.

Fine-quality rubies are exceptionally rare—rarer than diamonds of equivalent quality. The most sought-after specimens come from the Mogok Valley in Myanmar, where rubies have been mined for over 800 years. Today, significant deposits are also found in Mozambique, which has become an important source of high-quality stones. The rarity of large, high-quality rubies means that exceptional specimens often command prices that exceed those of diamonds.

## The History of Ruby

### Ancient Origins

Throughout human history, ruby has held a place of supreme honor among gemstones. Ancient Sanskrit texts referred to ruby as "ratnaraj," meaning "king of precious stones," reflecting the reverence this gem commanded in Indian culture. Hindu tradition held that offering rubies to the god Krishna would guarantee rebirth as an emperor.

In ancient Burma, warriors believed that rubies made them invincible in battle. So strong was this belief that some warriors would insert rubies into their flesh, convinced that the stones would provide supernatural protection. This practice speaks to the deep conviction that ruby possessed powers beyond mere adornment.

Ancient Romans associated ruby with Mars, the god of war, believing the stone embodied the fierce energy and passionate nature of the deity. They thought that rubies could preserve physical and mental health, settling disputes and bringing peace to enemies. Medieval Europeans continued these traditions, viewing ruby as a stone of prophecy that would darken when danger approached.

### How It Became July's Birthstone

The tradition of birthstones has roots in ancient history, with connections to the twelve stones in the High Priest's breastplate described in the Book of Exodus. However, the modern birthstone list was standardized in 1912 by the American National Retail Jewelers Association (now Jewelers of America).

Ruby was assigned to July, a connection that resonates deeply with the month's character. July falls at the height of summer in the Northern Hemisphere, a time of intense heat and vitality. Ruby's fiery red color perfectly captures this season of passion and energy. The association also aligns with July's zodiac signs—Cancer and Leo—both of which benefit from ruby's protective and empowering qualities.

### Famous Ruby Specimens

Among the world's most famous rubies is the Sunrise Ruby, a 25.59-carat Burmese ruby that sold at auction in 2015 for $30.42 million, setting a world record for any ruby at the time. Its exceptional "pigeon blood" color and remarkable clarity make it one of the finest rubies ever discovered.

The Liberty Bell Ruby, carved into a miniature replica of the Liberty Bell, weighed an astonishing 8,500 carats before it was tragically stolen in 2011. The DeLong Star Ruby, a 100.32-carat star ruby now housed in the American Museum of Natural History, showcases the mesmerizing asterism that makes star rubies so captivating.

Royal collections worldwide feature magnificent rubies. The Black Prince's Ruby in the British Imperial State Crown—though actually a spinel—demonstrates how highly red gems were valued throughout history that they were often assumed to be rubies.

### Primary Symbolism: Passion, Protection, Prosperity

Ruby's deep red color has forever linked it to the vital force of life itself—blood, fire, and the passionate heart. This connection is not merely aesthetic; it reflects centuries of cultural belief that ruby contains the essence of life's most powerful energies.

Passion is perhaps ruby's most recognized association. The stone is believed to ignite the fire within, awakening enthusiasm, motivation, and the courage to pursue one's deepest desires.

## Spiritual Properties of Ruby

*Note: These are traditional beliefs, not medical advice.*

### Energy & Vibration

In crystal healing traditions, ruby is considered one of the most powerful stones for activating life force energy, often called chi or prana. Its vibration is believed to be intensely stimulating, awakening dormant energies and motivating action. Those who work with ruby often describe feeling a surge of vitality and renewed purpose.

Ruby's energy is thought to resonate with the element of fire, bringing warmth to cold emotions and light to dark times. It is often recommended for those experiencing lethargy, depression, or lack of motivation, as its vibrant frequency may help rekindle the inner flame. The stone is also believed to enhance concentration and mental clarity when one feels scattered or unfocused.

### Chakra Connection

- **Associated Chakra:** Root Chakra (Muladhara) and Heart Chakra (Anahata)
- **Energy Flow:** Ruby is believed to ground energy through the root chakra while simultaneously opening the heart. This dual action is thought to create a powerful flow of vital energy through the body, connecting earthly stability with emotional expansion. Some practitioners also associate ruby with the solar plexus chakra, linking it to personal power and will.

### Meditation & Mindfulness

Working with ruby in meditation is believed to help access deeper states of passion and purpose. Practitioners often hold or place the stone near the heart or base of the spine while focusing on questions of life direction, relationship intentions, or creative inspiration.

A common practice involves visualizing ruby's red light filling the body with each breath, imagining vitality and courage growing stronger with each inhale. This visualization may help those seeking to overcome fear, make difficult decisions, or reconnect with their authentic desires.

### Cleansing & Charging

Ruby is believed to benefit from regular energetic cleansing due to its absorbent nature. Traditional methods include placing the stone in morning sunlight for short periods (being careful not to fade the color with extended exposure), cleansing with the smoke of sage or palo santo, or placing it on a bed of sea salt overnight.

To charge ruby's energy, many practitioners recommend setting it under the full moon or placing it near other high-energy crystals like clear quartz. Some traditions suggest holding the stone while focusing on intentions, programming it with specific goals or desires.

## Wearing & Caring for Ruby

### Jewelry Guide

| Type | Suitability | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Rings | Excellent | Ruby's hardness makes it ideal for daily wear; protective settings recommended for active lifestyles |
| Necklaces | Excellent | Beautiful as pendants or strand necklaces; sits close to the heart chakra |
| Earrings | Excellent | Lightweight and well-protected position; showcases color beautifully |
| Bracelets | Good | Suitable but consider protective settings due to potential impact |

### Quality Factors

- **Color:** The most important factor. Look for vivid, saturated red without being too dark or too light. The finest "pigeon blood" rubies command premium prices.
- **Clarity:** While inclusions are common, eye-clean stones are preferred. Some "silk" inclusions can actually enhance beauty.
- **Cut:** Quality cutting maximizes color and brilliance. Look for symmetry and good light return.
- **Carat:** Large, high-quality rubies are exceptionally rare. Prices increase exponentially with size.

### Care Instructions

Ruby's exceptional hardness makes it relatively easy to care for, but proper attention ensures lasting beauty. Clean your ruby jewelry with warm water, mild dish soap, and a soft brush. Rinse thoroughly and dry with a lint-free cloth. Ultrasonic and steam cleaners are generally safe for untreated rubies but should be avoided for treated stones.

Store ruby jewelry separately from other pieces to prevent scratching softer gems. While ruby is very durable, it can still chip if struck hard at certain angles, so remove rings during activities like gardening or sports. Avoid exposure to harsh chemicals, which may affect treated stones or damage metal settings.

### Buying Tips

When purchasing ruby, prioritize color above all other factors. A smaller stone with exceptional color often holds more value than a larger stone with inferior hue. Be aware that most rubies on the market have undergone heat treatment to enhance color—this is an accepted industry practice and should be disclosed by reputable sellers.

Natural, untreated rubies command significant premiums. If budget is a concern, consider treated stones from reputable sources or explore high-quality lab-created rubies, which offer the same chemical composition at lower prices. Always purchase from certified dealers who provide documentation of treatments and origin. For significant purchases, obtain an independent laboratory certificate from organizations like GIA or AGL.

## July Stone & Flower Harmony

### Larkspur: Your Companion Flower

The larkspur, July's birth flower, rises tall and elegant in summer gardens, its delicate spurred blooms creating spires of color that reach toward the sun. Available in shades of purple, pink, white, and blue, larkspur represents lightness, levity, and an open heart. The flower's name comes from the spur-shaped projection behind each bloom, reminiscent of a lark's claw.

In the language of flowers, larkspur communicates strong bonds of love, a beautiful lightness of being, and the celebration of successful ventures. It has long been associated with protection—particularly safe travel across water—and was once believed to ward off ghosts and scorpions when hung in doorways.

### Stone-Flower Synergy

Ruby and larkspur create a powerful complementary pair for July's children. Where ruby provides grounding, passionate energy, larkspur offers lightness and joy. Together, they suggest a balanced approach to life: being deeply committed yet maintaining an open, playful spirit.

Both ruby and larkspur carry protective qualities in their folklore—ruby guarding the body and spirit, larkspur warding off negativity. This shared attribute reinforces July's theme of powerful protection. The contrast between ruby's intense red and larkspur's cool purples and blues reflects the balance between fire and water, passion and peace, that July-born individuals may cultivate in their lives.
