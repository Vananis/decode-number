### Description

Peridot is one of the few gemstones that occurs in only one color—green. However, this green varies from yellow-green to olive to brownish-green, depending on the amount of iron present in the crystal structure. The most valued peridot displays a rich, grass-green color with golden undertones, often described as lime or olive green.

Unlike many gemstones that form deep within the Earth's crust, peridot forms much deeper—in the Earth's mantle—and is brought to the surface through volcanic activity. This unique origin gives peridot a special place in gemological history. Fine peridot specimens exhibit excellent transparency and a distinctive oily or greasy luster that distinguishes them from other green gems.

Quality peridot should display vivid color saturation without appearing too dark or too pale. The stone's characteristic double refraction can sometimes be seen with the naked eye, creating a slight doubling effect of the back facets when viewed through the table of a cut gem.

### Formation & Rarity

Peridot forms deep within the Earth's mantle, typically at depths of 20 to 55 miles below the surface. The crystals develop in magma-rich environments and are carried upward by volcanic eruptions or tectonic activity. This explains why peridot is often found in volcanic regions and, remarkably, in some meteorites that have fallen to Earth.

While peridot is not exceptionally rare, gem-quality specimens of significant size are relatively uncommon. The finest peridot historically came from the Egyptian island of Zabargad (St. John's Island) in the Red Sea, which produced exceptional stones for over 3,500 years. Today, the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona produces approximately 80-95% of the world's commercial peridot supply, though Pakistani and Myanmar sources yield larger, higher-quality crystals prized by collectors.

## The History of Peridot

### Ancient Origins

Peridot holds one of the longest histories of any gemstone, with evidence of mining dating back to at least 1500 BCE on the Egyptian island of Zabargad. The ancient Egyptians called peridot the "gem of the sun" and believed it protected its wearer from terrors of the night, especially when set in gold. Cleopatra's famous emerald collection may have actually contained many peridots, as the stones were frequently confused in antiquity.

The ancient Romans also cherished peridot, calling it "evening emerald" because its green color remained visible under lamplight, unlike true emeralds which appeared darker. Roman soldiers often wore peridot talismans for protection in battle and to ward off enchantments. The stone appears in historical records throughout the Mediterranean world, from Greek temples to early Christian churches.

In Hawaiian tradition, peridot is believed to be the tears of Pele, the goddess of volcanoes and fire. This association makes sense given that peridot is found in volcanic deposits throughout the Hawaiian Islands. Ancient Hawaiians used peridot in jewelry and ceremonial objects, viewing it as a symbol of divine protection.

### How It Became August's Birthstone

The modern birthstone list was standardized in 1912 by the American National Retail Jewelers Association (now Jewelers of America), which officially designated peridot as August's birthstone. However, the association between peridot and late summer dates back much further. Medieval Europeans associated the stone with the height of summer's heat, believing its green color represented the flourishing of nature.

The original birthstone traditions have roots in the biblical breastplate of Aaron, which featured twelve gemstones representing the twelve tribes of Israel. While scholars debate which stone in the breastplate corresponds to modern peridot, the tradition of assigning specific gems to months evolved through Jewish, Roman, and eventually Christian traditions before reaching its modern form.

### Famous Peridot Specimens

The Shrine of the Three Holy Kings in Germany's Cologne Cathedral features what were long believed to be emeralds but are now known to be peridots. These stones, some of the largest ever found, came from the ancient Zabargad mines and demonstrate the historical confusion between the two green gems.

The Smithsonian Institution houses a remarkable 310-carat peridot from Zabargad, one of the finest specimens of its kind. The gem displays the rich olive-green color characteristic of stones from this legendary source. Other significant peridots appear in the crown jewels of several European nations, though many were originally catalogued as emeralds.

In 2005, the Mars Exploration Rover detected olivine on Mars, making peridot the first gem mineral discovered on another planet. Peridot has also been found in pallasite meteorites, ancient space rocks that formed during the early solar system. The Esquel pallasite, discovered in Argentina, contains gem-quality peridot crystals suspended in a metallic matrix, creating some of the most extraordinary specimens ever seen.

## The Meaning of Peridot

### Primary Symbolism: Strength, Protection, Healing

Peridot's core symbolism centers on strength—both physical and emotional. Throughout history, the stone has been associated with the power to overcome challenges and emerge renewed. This connection likely stems from peridot's volcanic origins, as it literally forms under immense pressure and heat deep within the Earth.

The protective qualities attributed to peridot span many cultures. Ancient Egyptians wore peridot to guard against nightmares and evil spirits. Medieval Europeans believed the stone could drive away enchantments and dispel melancholy. This protective reputation may derive from peridot's association with light—its ability to glow green even in dim conditions suggested it carried an inner light that darkness could not extinguish.

Healing associations with peridot focus on emotional and spiritual recovery rather than physical ailments. The stone is traditionally believed to help release negative patterns, promote forgiveness, and restore balance after difficult experiences. Its green color connects it to growth and renewal, making it a symbol of starting fresh and letting go of the past.

### Traditional Associations

- **Emotional:** Confidence, warmth, openness, joy, and release of jealousy or resentment
- **Spiritual:** Protection from negative energies, connection to nature, spiritual growth, and enlightenment
- **Physical:** Traditionally thought to support the heart, lungs, and digestive system (note: these are historical beliefs, not medical claims)

### In Different Cultures

| Culture | Belief |
|---------|--------|
| Ancient Egyptian | Sacred "gem of the sun" with protective powers against darkness and evil |
| Ancient Roman | "Evening emerald" that enhanced eloquence and brought success in relationships |
| Medieval European | Dispelled enchantments, warded off evil spirits, and cured depression |
| Modern Spiritual | Stone of transformation, abundance, and emotional healing |

## Spiritual Properties of Peridot

*Note: These are traditional beliefs, not medical advice.*

### Energy & Vibration

In crystal healing traditions, peridot is believed to carry a high-frequency energy that promotes positivity and wards off negativity. Practitioners often describe the stone's vibration as bright, cleansing, and activating—like sunshine captured in mineral form. This energy is thought to help clear stagnant emotions and patterns that no longer serve one's growth.

The stone's connection to volcanic forces gives it an association with transformation. Just as volcanoes reshape landscapes, peridot is traditionally believed to help reshape emotional patterns and outdated beliefs. This transformative energy is often described as gentle yet persistent, supporting gradual change rather than sudden upheaval.

### Chakra Connection

- **Associated Chakra:** Heart Chakra (Anahata) and Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura)
- **Energy Flow:** Peridot is believed to bridge these two energy centers, connecting personal power (solar plexus) with compassion and love (heart). This dual connection is thought to help align one's will with one's highest good, promoting actions that serve both self and others.

### Meditation & Mindfulness

Many people incorporate peridot into meditation practices focused on release and renewal. Holding or gazing at peridot while meditating is traditionally believed to help surface and clear negative emotions, particularly jealousy, resentment, and self-doubt. Some practitioners place peridot on the solar plexus or heart during meditation to enhance these effects.

Peridot is also used in gratitude practices, as its association with abundance is believed to help shift focus from scarcity to appreciation. Simple practices might include holding peridot while mentally listing things to be grateful for, or keeping the stone visible as a reminder to cultivate a positive outlook.

### Cleansing & Charging

Traditional methods for cleansing peridot include:
- Placing it in morning sunlight for brief periods (avoid prolonged exposure to prevent fading)
- Resting it on a bed of sea salt overnight
- Smudging with sage or palo santo
- Placing it near clear quartz or selenite

To charge peridot, many practitioners recommend leaving it under the light of a waxing or full moon, or placing it among living plants to reconnect with its earth-based energy.

## Wearing & Caring for Peridot

### Jewelry Guide

| Type | Suitability | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Rings | Good with care | Best in protective settings for everyday wear; remove during heavy activities |
| Necklaces | Excellent | Well-suited for pendants and necklaces; lower risk of impact |
| Earrings | Excellent | Ideal setting with minimal wear concerns |
| Bracelets | Good with care | Choose sturdy settings; remove during physical activities |

### Quality Factors

- **Color:** The most valued peridots display a vivid, saturated green without brown or yellow overtones. Look for rich grass-green or olive-green hues.
- **Clarity:** High-quality peridot should be eye-clean with no visible inclusions. Some stones may show tiny black specks (chromite) or silk-like inclusions.
- **Cut:** Well-cut peridot maximizes its characteristic sparkle and color. Common cuts include round, oval, cushion, and emerald cuts.
- **Carat:** Fine-quality peridots over 10 carats are relatively rare and command premium prices. Stones between 1-5 carats offer excellent value.

### Care Instructions

Peridot rates 6.5-7 on the Mohs hardness scale, making it moderately durable but susceptible to scratching by harder materials. Clean peridot jewelry with warm, soapy water and a soft brush. Avoid ultrasonic cleaners, steam cleaning, and harsh chemicals, as peridot can be sensitive to rapid temperature changes and acidic substances.

Store peridot jewelry separately from harder gems like diamonds, sapphires, and rubies to prevent scratching. A soft cloth pouch or lined jewelry box works well. Remove peridot rings and bracelets before engaging in activities that might subject them to impact or abrasion.

### Buying Tips

When purchasing peridot, prioritize color over size—a smaller stone with excellent color is more valuable than a larger pale specimen. Natural peridot is relatively affordable compared to other gemstones, making it accessible for most budgets. Prices increase significantly for stones over 5 carats with top color.

Peridot is rarely treated, so most stones on the market are natural and untreated. However, be aware of glass imitations or synthetic versions. A reputable jeweler should provide certification for significant purchases. For the finest specimens, look for stones from Myanmar, Pakistan, or historic Zabargad pieces.

## August Stone & Flower Harmony

### Gladiolus: Your Companion Flower

The gladiolus, August's birth flower, rises tall and proud with sword-shaped leaves and dramatic flower spikes. Its name derives from the Latin "gladius" (sword), connecting it to themes of strength and moral integrity. Gladioli bloom in a spectacular range of colors, from soft pastels to vibrant reds, making them favorites for summer gardens and floral arrangements.

Throughout history, gladioli have symbolized strength of character, sincerity, and remembrance. Roman gladiators wore gladiolus corms for protection and victory. In the Victorian language of flowers, giving gladioli communicated that the recipient's character was deeply admired.

### Stone-Flower Synergy

Peridot and gladiolus share a powerful symbolic connection through their mutual associations with strength and resilience. Both represent the ability to stand tall through challenges—peridot formed under volcanic pressure, gladiolus rising boldly toward the sun. Together, they create a complete picture of August's energy: inner strength paired with outward expression.

The gladiolus's association with sincerity and moral character complements peridot's traditional role in promoting honesty and releasing negative emotions. August-born individuals can draw on both symbols to cultivate authentic self-expression grounded in integrity. The flower's sword-like form also echoes the protective qualities attributed to peridot throughout history.
