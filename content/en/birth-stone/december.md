### Description

Turquoise is one of the oldest known gemstones in human history, captivating civilizations for over 5,000 years with its distinctive blue-green hue. This opaque stone ranges from sky blue to greenish-blue, with its most prized color being an intense "robin's egg" blue. The variations in color come from the stone's copper and iron content—more copper produces bluer stones, while iron creates greener tones.

What makes turquoise visually distinctive is often its matrix—the web-like veining of the host rock that runs through the stone. While some prefer perfectly uniform turquoise, many collectors prize specimens with attractive matrix patterns in brown, black, or gold, which create unique, one-of-a-kind pieces. This natural patterning has given each turquoise stone its own fingerprint.

Quality turquoise is judged by its color saturation, hardness, and polish ability. The finest specimens come from the Nishapur district of Iran, known for producing intense blue turquoise with minimal matrix. American turquoise from Arizona's Sleeping Beauty mine was renowned for its pure blue color, though the mine has since closed, making these stones increasingly valuable.

### Formation & Rarity

Turquoise forms through a complex geological process that requires very specific conditions. When acidic, copper-rich groundwater seeps through rock containing aluminum and phosphorus, the chemical reaction creates turquoise over millions of years. This typically occurs in arid regions where the water table fluctuates, which is why turquoise deposits are found in desert environments.

High-quality natural turquoise has become increasingly rare. Many mines have been depleted or closed, and new deposits of gem-quality material are uncommon. This scarcity has made untreated, natural turquoise highly sought after by collectors. Most turquoise on the market today has been stabilized or enhanced to improve its durability and color, making truly natural specimens particularly valuable.

## The History of Turquoise

### Ancient Origins

Turquoise holds the distinction of being one of the first gemstones ever mined by humans. The ancient Egyptians were extracting turquoise from the Sinai Peninsula as early as 3200 BCE. They adorned their pharaohs with this sky-blue stone, believing it offered protection in the afterlife. King Tutankhamun's famous burial mask features prominent turquoise inlays alongside gold and lapis lazuli.

In Persia (modern-day Iran), turquoise was considered the national stone and worn extensively as protection against unnatural death. The Persians believed that turquoise would change color to warn its wearer of impending danger—a belief that persisted for centuries. The word "turquoise" itself derives from the French "pierre turquoise," meaning "Turkish stone," as the gems first reached Europe through Turkish trading routes.

Native American cultures, particularly in the American Southwest, developed deep spiritual connections with turquoise over thousands of years. The Navajo, Zuni, and Pueblo peoples considered it a sacred stone that connected earth and sky. They used turquoise in ceremonial objects, jewelry, and as offerings to the gods. Apache warriors believed that attaching turquoise to their bows improved their accuracy in hunting.

### How It Became December's Birthstone

The modern birthstone list was standardized by the American National Retail Jewelers Association (now Jewelers of America) in 1912. However, birthstone traditions trace back much further. December's association with turquoise likely stems from ancient beliefs that the stone could protect against winter's hardships and bring good fortune as the old year ended.

Prior to the 1912 standardization, various gems competed for December's designation. Turquoise won its place through its long history of being associated with protection and prosperity—qualities particularly valued during the darkest month of the year. In 2002, tanzanite was added as an alternative December birthstone, and zircon is also recognized, giving December celebrants a wonderful variety of options.

### Famous Turquoise Specimens

The Persian Crown Jewels contain some of the world's most spectacular turquoise specimens. The ceremonial throne of the Persian emperors features extensive turquoise decoration, symbolizing heaven and imperial power. These stones, sourced from the legendary Nishapur mines, represent the finest quality turquoise ever discovered.

In the Americas, the Tiffany & Co. collection features exceptional examples of American turquoise, including specimens from the now-closed Cerrillos mines in New Mexico—the oldest turquoise mines in North America, worked by Native peoples for over 1,000 years. The Smithsonian Institution houses the "Aztec Turquoise Serpent," a stunning artifact created by Aztec artisans that demonstrates the stone's importance in Mesoamerican culture.

## The Meaning of Turquoise

### Primary Symbolism: Protection, Healing, Good Fortune

Turquoise has carried the symbolism of protection across virtually every culture that has encountered it. This association likely developed from the stone's color—reminiscent of both the protective sky above and healing waters—combined with early observations that the stone seemed to "warn" wearers of danger by changing color (actually a chemical reaction to oils and environmental factors).

The healing associations of turquoise are equally ancient. Traditional healers in many cultures believed that turquoise could draw illness from the body and restore balance. While modern science doesn't support these claims, the practice of using turquoise for comfort and wellness continues in crystal healing traditions today.

Good fortune and turquoise have been linked since ancient times. The stone was commonly given as a gift to ensure prosperity, particularly for travelers setting out on journeys. This connection to luck and successful ventures made turquoise a popular talisman for merchants, explorers, and anyone facing uncertain futures.

### Traditional Associations

- **Emotional:** Tranquility, communication, friendship, and emotional balance
- **Spiritual:** Protection against negative energy, connection to higher wisdom, spiritual grounding
- **Physical:** Traditionally believed to support throat and respiratory health, though these are folklore beliefs rather than medical facts

### In Different Cultures

| Culture | Belief |
|---------|--------|
| Ancient Egyptian | Sacred to Hathor, goddess of joy; ensured safe passage to the afterlife |
| Persian | Protected against evil eye; changed color to warn of danger |
| Native American | Sacred bridge between earth and sky; enhanced prayer and spiritual communication |
| Tibetan | Considered more valuable than gold; symbolized good health and fortune |
| Modern Western | Symbol of friendship, December birthstone, bohemian style icon |

## December Birthstone Personality

Those who wear turquoise or are born in December are often associated with:

### Core Traits

**Protective and Loyal**
Like their birthstone's primary meaning, December-born individuals are often described as fiercely protective of those they love. This protective nature extends to their communities and causes they believe in. They tend to be the friends who show up in difficult times, offering both emotional and practical support.

**Natural Communicators**
Turquoise's association with the throat chakra connects to December personalities' often natural ability to express themselves. Those drawn to turquoise may find they have a gift for finding the right words, mediating conflicts, or helping others articulate their thoughts. The stone's blue color, reminiscent of clear skies, symbolizes this clarity of expression.

**Seekers of Truth and Wisdom**
The ancient associations between turquoise and spiritual wisdom reflect in the December personality's tendency toward philosophical thinking. Those born under turquoise's influence are often described as old souls—people who seek meaning beyond the surface and value authentic connections over superficial ones.

### Strengths Enhanced

- Strong intuition and ability to read situations accurately
- Natural leadership that inspires trust in others
- Resilience in facing life's challenges
- Genuine warmth that attracts lasting friendships

### Challenges to Balance

*These associations are based on gemstone folklore and spiritual traditions.*

## Spiritual Properties of Turquoise

*Note: These are traditional beliefs, not medical advice.*

### Energy & Vibration

In crystal healing traditions, turquoise is considered a master healer with a calming, protective energy. Practitioners believe it creates a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms, helping to align all the chakras while strengthening overall energy flow. The stone is thought to carry both the energy of the sky (father sky) and earth (mother earth), creating balance between masculine and feminine energies.

Turquoise's vibration is often described as purifying and uplifting. Those who work with crystals suggest that turquoise may help dispel negative energy and electromagnetic pollution while promoting honest communication and self-expression. Its energy is believed to be particularly supportive during times of change or new beginnings.

### Chakra Connection

- **Associated Chakra:** Throat Chakra (Vishuddha)
- **Energy Flow:** Turquoise is believed to open and heal the throat chakra, enhancing communication, self-expression, and the ability to speak one's truth. Some practitioners also associate it with the third eye chakra for intuition.

### Meditation & Mindfulness

For those who include crystals in their meditation practice, turquoise is often used to promote peace and protection during spiritual work. Holding turquoise or placing it on the throat during meditation is thought to enhance verbal expression of spiritual insights and help release old patterns of thinking.

Many practitioners recommend meditating with turquoise when preparing for important conversations or when seeking clarity about life decisions. The stone's calming blue color provides a natural focal point for visualization exercises, particularly those involving clear communication or protection.

### Cleansing & Charging

Traditional methods for maintaining turquoise's energy include:

- **Moonlight:** Placing turquoise under the full moon overnight is believed to cleanse and recharge its energy
- **Sound:** Using singing bowls or bells near the stone
- **Smudging:** Passing turquoise through sage or palo santo smoke
- **Earth:** Burying briefly in the earth (though this should be done carefully as turquoise is porous)

Note: Turquoise should never be cleansed with salt or left in direct sunlight for extended periods, as this can damage the stone's color and structure.

## Wearing & Caring for Turquoise

### Jewelry Guide

| Type | Suitability | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Rings | Caution | Best in protective settings; not ideal for daily wear due to softness |
| Necklaces | Excellent | Traditional choice; supports throat chakra connection |
| Earrings | Excellent | Light wear makes earrings ideal for turquoise |
| Bracelets | Good | Choose bezel settings; expect some patina development over time |

### Quality Factors

- **Color:** The most valuable turquoise displays a consistent, saturated blue. "Robin's egg blue" or "Persian blue" are considered ideal. Green-toned turquoise is generally less valuable but can be attractive.
- **Clarity:** Look for stones without excessive matrix, cracks, or surface pitting. Some matrix can enhance value if the pattern is attractive.
- **Cut:** Turquoise is typically cut as cabochons or beads. The cut should showcase the stone's color while minimizing visible flaws.
- **Carat:** Larger stones of high quality are increasingly rare. Size premiums apply for fine specimens over 10 carats.

### Care Instructions

Turquoise requires more careful handling than many gemstones due to its relative softness and porous nature. The stone can absorb oils, perfumes, and other substances that may permanently alter its color—though some people appreciate the patina this creates over time.

To clean turquoise, use only a soft, dry cloth or slightly damp cloth with plain water. Never use chemical cleaners, ultrasonic cleaners, or steam cleaning. Store turquoise separately from harder stones that could scratch it, ideally wrapped in soft cloth. Remove turquoise jewelry before swimming, bathing, applying lotions or perfumes, or engaging in physical activities.

### Buying Tips

When purchasing turquoise, be aware that most commercial turquoise has been treated in some way. "Stabilized" turquoise has been impregnated with resin to improve durability—this is common and acceptable but should be disclosed. "Enhanced" turquoise may have had its color improved artificially.

Natural, untreated turquoise commands premium prices and is relatively rare in the marketplace. Ask sellers directly about treatments and expect to pay significantly more for natural material. For important purchases, consider getting a laboratory certification. Price ranges vary enormously based on quality, from a few dollars per carat for treated material to hundreds of dollars per carat for fine natural specimens.

## December Stone & Flower Harmony

### Poinsettia: Your Companion Flower

The poinsettia, with its brilliant red bracts and deep green leaves, has become synonymous with December celebrations. Native to Mexico, where it was valued by the Aztecs for both its beauty and practical uses, the poinsettia symbolizes good cheer, success, and celebration. In the language of flowers, it represents wishes of joy and holiday blessings.

Like turquoise, the poinsettia carries associations with celebration and goodwill. Its striking appearance during the darkest month of the year brings color and life indoors, much as turquoise's vibrant blue-green has lifted spirits across cultures for millennia.

### Stone-Flower Synergy

Turquoise and poinsettia create a beautiful symbolic pairing for December-born individuals. While turquoise offers protection and healing through life's journeys, the poinsettia celebrates achievement and brings warmth to endings and new beginnings. Together, they represent the December spirit—honoring the past year while looking forward with hope.

The color contrast between turquoise's cool blues and the poinsettia's warm reds also creates visual harmony, representing balance between contemplation and celebration. Those born in December carry both energies: the reflective wisdom of turquoise and the vibrant joy of the poinsettia.
